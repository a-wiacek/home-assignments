Collection of code solutions to home assignments from various courses in University of Warsaw.

Few notes:
1. Each problem has short description in English.
2. Some parts (readmes prepared for courses, in-code text shown to user, detailed description of task, ...) are in Polish and I'm not going to translate it.
3. Here I am showing only my work that was not based on any code provided by author of assignment (except for commonly used `err.h` and `err.c`).
4. In one course we were working in pairs. These tasks are in another repositories.
