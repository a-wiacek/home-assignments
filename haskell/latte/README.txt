Compiler of a simple imperative language to LLVM with SSA.
Language has loops, mutually recursive functions, strings support, arrays (1D only) and classes with virtual methods.
I also implemented optimizations of code: dead code elimination, constant folding/propagation, common subexpression elimination, strength reduction.
